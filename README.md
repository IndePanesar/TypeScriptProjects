This repo has sample code developed whilst learning TypeScript from the book Essential TypeSCript by Adam Freeman
Install Typescript *npm install -g typescript*
To check its installed ok verify with command
*tsc --version*.

The Typescript package installed has a compiler, *(tsc)*, that converts TypeScript into Javascript

In chapter 1 we create a *ToDoList* application
*tsconfig.json* is the configuration file for the TypeScript compiler.
