This repo has sample code developed whilst learning TypeScript from the book Essential TypeSCript by Adam Freeman
Install Typescript ***npm install -g typescript***
To check its installed ok verify with command
***tsc --version***.

The Typescript package installed has a compiler, ***(tsc)***, that converts TypeScript into Javascript

In chapter 1 we create a ***ToDoList*** application. The application manages a todo list where the user is able to view the list items and perform various actions on the items of the list.
***tsconfig.json*** is the configuration file for the TypeScript compiler.
